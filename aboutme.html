                    <p>
                        I am a Laotian American whose parents come from Laos. I have one young sister and one older brother. 
                        Growing up there were no expectations forced on me to do well in school or take care of responsibilties around the house whether it was to clean up 
                        around the house or watch my younger sister. Even though I was a middle child, I was an independent child most of the time, creating my own expectations 
                        for myself ending up for better or worse. However, this allowed me to get where I am today by attending college and always staying motivated to keep moving 
                        through problems. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Cars</h3>

                        <li>
                            I have a very high interest in things car related, sharing this interest with my older brother and always watching or helping my uncle fix his own vehicles as a 
                            child. Fascinated by the mechanics and many things that make a car, I am always learning something new about the vehicles manufacturers make. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This interest has coexisted with my knowledge as a software engineer as well, because modern cars also use software these days and thereâ€™s many different programs 
                            in a car for individual modules that are a part of a car.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <!--interest 2-->
                    <h3>Technological Things</h3>

                        <li>
                            Computers have always interested me at a young age (~ 7 yrs old), starting with my very first Dell Lattitude D620 laptop. 
                            Yes, I still remember exactly what model it was.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I also always tinkered with the operating systems as a child, both learning from mistakes I caused and 
                            fixing problems that arise (thanks Windows XP/Vista).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            From being exposed to computers, that led me to stay interested in many products being released growing up, 
                            from smartphones, TVs, at one point I even tried to understand appliances like washing machines. 
                        </li>
