Changes since HW3:
1. added a link in navbar to styledcrud.html (maybe not needed but is for the TAs ease of accessibility)
2. added a google analytic script to about me, to see how many people have viewed my work/portfolio experience. Ideally if there is many people who view my portfolio website but no one has contacted me, it could mean there needs to be some adjustment in content.
